When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I'm working from multiple computers or working with multiple people. This would make sure all my code looks the same regardless of computer. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored locally? 

That way you don't have to be connected to internet to compare changes
you've made to any changes that were made on the remote repository.
