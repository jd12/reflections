When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I'm working from multiple computers or working with multiple people. This would make sure all my code looks the same regardless of computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes automatically could interfere with the files you're currently working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones on Github. Clones are copies of repository on your local machine. Branches are part of one repository, to experiment with different features. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored locally? 

That way you don't have to be connected to internet to compare changes
you've made to any changes that were made on the remote repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder? 

You would have to use a lot of email or meet frequently in person. 
It would be much harder to work on the work seperately. 
It might be easier to bring novice programmers on, as they 
would not need to lear how to use Github. 

When would you want to make changes in a seperate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have? 

If you're working on a specfic feature it's great to have a branch. Also if you don't want to mess up the master branch you can checkout a different branch and work on it before merging with the master branch. That way your master branch is pretty much in sync with the remote branch.
