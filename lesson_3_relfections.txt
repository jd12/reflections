When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I'm working from multiple computers or working with multiple people. This would make sure all my code looks the same regardless of computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes automatically could interfere with the files you're currently working on
