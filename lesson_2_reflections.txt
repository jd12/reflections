What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you set up the directory to be tracked by git. You need to do this in order to let git know which directories you want to track. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that the repository is saved across commits and the staging area isn't. It also is not the working directory because you do not interact directly with files in the staging area. 

The value it offers is it helps give the user control as to what they're going to add to the repository. They don't have to commit the entire directory if they don't want to. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

When you've made a bunch of changes, you can break them up by adding certain files to the staging area and commiting them seperately
