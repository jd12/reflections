How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped to easily see what lines had been changed from the two files and once you got use to the format, made it very easy to see the error. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Help spot bugs easier. Help develop faster as I add on features on branches instead of on the main code that's functioning. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You use git log to see all the changes that have been made. You then use git diff to see the differences between two files. 


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can make changes freely and not have to worry that you won't be able to recover it. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use Git to keep track of all my projects and help my students collaborate on code.
