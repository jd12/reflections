how did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It helped me easily see what changes had been made and greatly reduced the amount of code I had to look at. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	When a huge bug arises, it will be much easier to find in a past history of the file. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 
	Pro- More control and meaningful commits. 
	Con- you have to rely on other people on what is "meaningful" 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file seperately? 
	For different purposes. Google docs is used for individual documents. It's rare that a change you make in one document has anything to do it with another document
	Git is designed for code where one logical change can mean manipulating multiple files. It would be cumbersome to have to commit all those different files.
